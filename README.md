# Advanced-Driver-Assistance-System
This is my graduation project which revolved around 4 main systems of the Advanced Driver Assistance System in a car. It comprised of: Driver Monitoring System, Lane Keeping Assistance System, Adaptive Cruise Control, and Traffic Sign Detection.
For the driver monitoring system folder, you will find the main code to be found in the facialTracking.py file. Install the whole folder as all of the files in it are dependent on each other.
