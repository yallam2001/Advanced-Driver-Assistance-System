# Advanced-Driver-Assistance-System
This is my graduation project which revolved around 4 main systems of the Advanced Driver Assistance System in a car. It comprised of: Driver Monitoring System, Lane Keeping Assistance System, Adaptive Cruise Control, and Traffic Sign Detection.
For the driver monitoring system folder, you will find the main code located in the facialTracking folder. Install the whole folder as all of the files in it are dependent on each other.
In the ADAS folder, our main code is called Final.py and you will need to download the .tflite files and include it in your environment to make sure the code runs without any error. As for the traffic sign detection, the following video will thoroughly explain the different steps to train and produce a trained model with the dataset included:

Make sure to download the required dependencies and packages when working with these python files in Pycharm.
